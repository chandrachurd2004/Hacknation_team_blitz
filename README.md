This project is based on Water Usage Tracking Device which moniters the polute in water. So, our idea is to put the device in inlet and outlet of every householed. This will let us give the data how that household uses the water provided to them. The sensor which we took are turbidity sensor ans flowmeter . The data will be processed in server or cloud. 

Imapct of the project:	
The data which we will get will be provided to the Company/Goverment Organisations which provide the water to this household , which will provide the sufficient information of water usage in a perticular house to them. 

Target of the project:
Goverment organisation and the Company that provide water to every house hold.
